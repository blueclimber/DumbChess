1.	Piece Class Tests
  a.	is_enemy:
    i.	Test with friendly and enemy pieces to confirm correct enemy detection.
  b.	is_within_bounds:
    i.	Validate positions within and outside of the 8x8 bounds.
  c.	path_clear:
    i.	Simulate blocked and unblocked paths for pieces that cannot jump (e.g., Rook, Queen).
    ii.	Include cases where pieces are between start and end positions, ensuring path_clear only returns True when the path is clear.
2.	King Movement Tests
  a.	Test valid moves (one square in any direction).
  b.	Test moves that go outside the 1-square range.
  c.	Test movement boundaries (e.g., moving to the edge of the board).
3.	Queen Movement Tests
  a.	Test straight-line movement (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) within bounds.
  b.	Test movement where the path is blocked.
  c.	Test invalid moves (not along straight or diagonal paths).
4.	Knight Movement Tests
  a.	Test standard L-shaped moves (2,1) and (1,2).
  b.	Confirm that the knight can move over other pieces by testing blocked paths.
  c.	Test moves outside the L-shape pattern.
5.	Bishop Movement Tests
  a.	Test diagonal moves with clear paths.
  b.	Test diagonal moves when another piece blocks the path.
  c.	Test invalid moves (non-diagonal).
6.	Rook Movement Tests
  a.	Test horizontal and vertical moves within bounds.
  b.	Test blocked paths to ensure path_clear works correctly.
  c.	Test invalid moves (non-linear paths).
7.	Pawn Movement Tests
  a.	Single Forward Move: Test moving forward one square when unblocked.
  b.	Double Forward Move: Test double-step move from starting position.
  c.	Capture Move: Test diagonal capture when an enemy piece is present.
  d.	Invalid Moves: Test invalid moves (e.g., moving backward or sideways).
8.	Edge Cases
  a.	Boundary Conditions: Test each piece at the edges of the board to ensure they do not move outside bounds.
  b.	Friendly Fire: Attempt to move pieces onto spaces occupied by friendly pieces to confirm moves are disallowed.
  c.	Enemy Capture: Test capturing enemy pieces for all pieces (if relevant to their movement).
  d.	Blocked Paths: Place friendly or enemy pieces in various positions to test path checking for pieces other than the knight.
